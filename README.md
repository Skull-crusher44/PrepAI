**PrepAI is an intelligent, real-time interview preparation platform designed to simulate realistic technical and behavioral interviews. By leveraging the Gemini API, it provides a dynamic environment where users can practice coding, answer resume-specific questions, and receive instant, actionable feedback.**

This project bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical interview performance by creating a low-pressure space for users to hone their skills.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üìÑ AI Resume Analysis**: Upload your resume (PDF/DOCX) and the AI parses it to ask personalized behavioral questions based on your experience and projects.
* **üíª Real-Time Technical Interviews**: Engage in a live coding session with a shared editor. The AI acts as your interviewer, observing your code as you type.
* **ü§ñ Instant AI-Powered Feedback**: Receive contextual hints and suggestions in real-time if you get stuck or make a syntax error, just like a helpful human interviewer.
* **üó£Ô∏è Personalized Behavioral Sessions**: The AI generates and asks questions directly related to your resume, such as, "Tell me more about the 'XYZ' project you listed."
* **üìä Performance Analytics Dashboard**: Get a comprehensive report after each session analyzing your coding proficiency, problem-solving approach, and communication skills.
* **üéôÔ∏è (Optional) Voice-to-Text Analysis**: Verbally explain your thought process and the AI can process the audio for a more holistic evaluation.
